<p>Knowing about the land we live on, and were born on, and whose land it is, is a wonderful learning activity for adults and students alike, and a great activity to take part in as an act of reconciliation.</p>

<p>I was born in Cranbrook, British Columbia, which is on Ktunaxa land. I live in Fernie, British Columbia, which is also on Ktunaxa land.</p>

<p>While my father and his family were not born in Canada, I can trace back my heritage in Canada several generations on my mother’s side.</p>

<p>My mother was born in Atikokan, Ontario, which is Ojibwe land. Her mother, and mother’s parents, were born in Nova Scotia, which is Mi’kmaq land. My mother’s father was born in Rush Lake, Saskatchewan, which is Cree land, and his mother was born in Blumenhof, Saskatchewan, which is also Cree land.</p>
