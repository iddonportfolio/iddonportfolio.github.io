<p>The second part of algebraic vector addition is to add our components and determine our resultant vector (the fancy way of saying our final answer).</p>

<p>If you want to add two or more vectors together using the algebraic method, you first need to decompose each vector into its x and y components. Be sure to label them</p>

<h2>Practice Problems</h2>
<p>Complete the following practice problems using the algebraic method of vector addition, rounding your answers to the nearest tenth. It would be best to attempt these problems before our Zoom meeting for this section that way if you have any questions you can ask them during our meeting.</p>
<ol>
<li>5 N @ 25&deg; North of West + 3 N @ 5&deg; West of North
	<ul>
		<li>Answer: 7.9 N @ 72.5&deg; West of North</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>2 N @ 30&deg; East of North + 2 N @ 45&deg; South of West
	<ul>
		<li>Answer: 0.5 N @ 52.5 West of North</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Assignment 3 – Due (<i><b>Date filled in for actual course to meet the course timeline.</i></b>)</h2>
<p>Your assignment is to answer the following questions on paper, showing all your work. Be sure to sketch each vector, break it into components, add the components, and then determine the resultant vector. Please use up (North) as your positive y direction and right (East) as your positive x direction, rounding your answers to the nearest tenth (the first decimal place).</p>

<p>When your assignment is complete, scan each page in your assignment or take a clear, high-resolution picture of each page, and then submit the images to me via email. Be sure to number each of your pages in the corner so I know what order your scanned pages go in.</p>
