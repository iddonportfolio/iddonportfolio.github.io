	<h2>Welcome to our Physics 20 unit on vector addition!</h2>

	
	
	<p>Since you’ve already learned about the difference between scalars and vectors, and seen how vectors work in one dimension, this unit will help you to be able to explore vectors by adding them in two dimensions. I assure you, two dimensional problems are way more applicable to many real world scenarios than you may even realize!</p>

<p>Need a quick review on what a vector is before we start? Click here (<a href="https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/vectors/Lesson-1/Vectors-and-Direction">https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/vectors/Lesson-1/Vectors-and-Direction</a>) for a link to a good page if you want some extra info to read (not required)!</p>

<p>In this unit we’ll be covering the Physics 20 program of studies objective consisting of:
<ul>
<li>20-B1.6K - calculate the resultant force, or its constituents, acting on an object by adding vector components graphically and algebraically.</li>
</ul>
or put a touch more simply, we’re going to learn two different ways of adding together vectors.</p>

<p>The unit is broken up into several sections below, and each has a Zoom meeting where we'll practice solving some example problems together where I'll work through each problem on the board, asking each of you what our next step should be. The Zoom meetings take place in the middle of each week so that you'll have time to work on that section's assignments after we've been able to practice together on Zoom as a class.</p>

<p>Each section has material for you to go through, as well as tasks for you to complete and submit. Below are the links to each section, along with the topic of that section and the due date for all parts to be completed in that section, and any additional important dates for that section.</p>

    <h2>Instructor Contact Information</h2>	


<p>Email: <a href="mailto:john.iddon@uleth.ca">john.iddon@uleth.ca</a></p>

<p>Zoom office hours: (<i><b>To be set upon use in actual teaching.</b></i>)</p>
<p>The Zoom office hours link was sent out to your email at the start of the course. It is not posted here to prevent it being abused by people who are not members of our class.</p>

<p>The easiest way to contact me is via email. I usually check my emails daily during weekdays, and will reply as soon as I am able to. If you’ve not heard back from me within a few days, do follow up with me by replying with another email as it’s possible a glitch occurred. I cannot guarantee availability on weekends, but if I’m around I’ll still try to respond (no promises though!).</p>

<p>If the set Zoom office hours don’t work for your schedule and you’d like to schedule an appointment for a different time, please email me some days and times that would work for you so we can try to schedule a meeting for a time that works for both of us.</p>
