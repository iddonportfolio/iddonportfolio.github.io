    <h2>Instructor Contact Information</h2>	


<p>Email: <a href="mailto:john.iddon@uleth.ca">john.iddon@uleth.ca</a></p>

<p>Zoom office hours: (<i><b>To be set upon use in actual teaching.</b></i>)</p>
<p>The Zoom office hours link was sent out to your email at the start of the course. It is not posted here to prevent it being abused by people who are not members of our class.</p>

<p>The easiest way to contact me is via email. I usually check my emails daily during weekdays, and will reply as soon as I am able to. If you’ve not heard back from me within a few days, do follow up with me by replying with another email as it’s possible a glitch occurred. I cannot guarantee availability on weekends, but if I’m around I’ll still try to respond (no promises though!).</p>

<p>If the set Zoom office hours don’t work for your schedule and you’d like to schedule an appointment for a different time, please email me some days and times that would work for you so we can try to schedule a meeting for a time that works for both of us.</p>
