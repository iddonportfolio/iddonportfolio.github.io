	<h1>PS1 - Order of Operations Math Lesson with Art Integration</h1>

<p>In the lesson included below, students work on solving order of operations problems, and I've chosen to include this lesson and sample of student work as it demonstrates the power and effectiveness to engage students in a topic they may not have the most interest in by leveraging their interest in another subject. All students were very engaged with, and completed, this project and all remained on task with the project, even those who didn’t enjoy math as much, attesting to the benefit of this project to engage them with the lesson content. The lesson also emphasizes the need to separate and show each individual step by having the students have to physically separate each step on a new paper cutout for the math mobile.</p>

<p>Included below is a sample of some of my students' work after this lesson, shared with permission of the students, and not including any identifying student information or faces to protect student privacy.</p>

	<h1>Grade 5 Electricity Lesson</h1>
	 <p>Included below is one of the lesson plans I developed during PS1. I've included this as an artifact to show my growth towards satisfying TQS 3 - "Demonstrating a Professional Body of Knowledge" by demonstrating what I've learned about planning, teaching, and assessment in a classroom lesson. I've also included a video of me teaching said lesson in an example scenario to my peers.</p>
