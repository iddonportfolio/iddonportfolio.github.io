	<h1>Physics 20 Gravitational Acceleration Unit</h1>
	<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>This unit focuses on teaching students about gravitational acceleration, a key part of the Physics 20 curriculum, and takes advantage of computational thinking concepts to enhance student learning and expertise in working with data and equations. The unit starts off looking at the background of Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation, where students will determine how to calculate gravitational acceleration, and moves on to expand the students’ expertise using real world tools such as spread sheets. Students then will gain experience developing tools to help conduct real world measurements, and culminates in students proving for themselves that the acceleration due to gravity is indeed able to be considered constant around the world for most kinds of calculations via a small excursion around the school and surrounding environment.</p>

<p>One key skill students will use and build in the unit, especially as it culminates, will be abstraction. There are so many details and measurable parameters in real world physics and engineering problems, so much so that if we didn’t approximate and abstract out certain unnecessary details many problems would be incredibly difficult or impossible to solve, with an overwhelming amount of things to calculate. Having experience with abstraction and focusing on which variables matter will enable students to recognize situations like this in the future where some details can be left constant (like the acceleration due to gravity on earth), since the change is so minor it doesn’t have a real world or measurable affect on the situation at hand. This memorable lab unit/experience/adventure will hopefully reinforce this critical physics and engineering concept for students so that they can add this use of abstraction to focus on the relevant details, and hold other minor variations constant, as a step to their algorithm they use to approach real world physics and engineering problems.</p>

<p>Something Professor Heidebrecht mentioned to me was the power and memorability of exciting activities for students, where he had students who remembered those activities years down the road and thus the learning contained within. One of my goals with this set of lessons, and the excursion taken at the end, was to make this learning about gravity, which we often take for granted, an exciting and memorable hands on experience with students proving to themselves, not just being told, that the acceleration due to gravity can be considered to be approximately constant anywhere on earth.</p>

<p>Also note that if your school’s schedule allowed for such, this unit could be integrated to collaborate with the mathematics 20 classes as well, since as noted in the Physics 20 program of studies there are many overlapping and related concepts from the mathematics 20 curriculum used within this unit, such as graphing, measurement and unit conversions, solving equations, and scale diagrams (Alberta Education, 2014). Being able to reinforce these mathematics, physics, and computational thinking concepts in different classes would hopefully benefit students in reinforcing the skills and knowledge through the use of repetition. For the case of this unit, I’ve written it only as a physics unit though, as those kinds of integrations with other classes would be specific to the school and other classroom teachers.</p>



<h2 id="lesson1">Lesson Plan 1</h2>
<p>Lesson 1 introduces Newton’s law of universal gravitation, where students will learn to solve for g and calculate g at two specific locations on earth. Students will make use of, and practice, decomposition and pattern recognition skills as they attempt to solve two equations for g, gravitational acceleration, looking for commonalities between the formulas, and simplifying them by breaking down the equations and reducing them to their simplest forms by canceling out equivalent variables on either side.</p>

<p>At the end of this lesson students would have their micro:bit displaying accelerometer data similar to the example shown in the GIF below.</p>

<p>Summary of lesson etc....</p>

<p>Please find below the embedded PDF for lesson plan 1.</p>


<p>After this section, students will have recorded their values measured for g, and will be able to write a conclusion that states something similar to the following: “In this investigation we were able to calculate the theoretical values of g as well as measure the values of g in our area using the micro:bit we programmed. Within the uncertainty of our sensors, the theoretical and measured values for the gravitational acceleration (g) agree, and thus with the variations being so small as we’ve calculated and measured, g can be considered a constant for most calculations”. Students will be informed as part of lesson 4 that they’ll need to include their recorded values of g in a table, and that their conclusion needs to explain whether their expected (theoretical) values of g agree with their measured value within uncertainty, and why you can consider g to be constant on the surface of the earth for most calculations, and that the work for this section will be out of three, one mark for each part.</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>The work from these lessons would be compiled into a report, based upon the standards that would have been previously set for the content of a report at the start of the Physics 20 class. Along with the standard requirements from the report, included would also be the table created in lesson 2, the code created in lesson 3, the table of values recorded for g in lesson 4, and their conclusion. Each section would be marked with the rubric included with each exemplar shown after the lessons above, rubrics which would be given to students as part of each lesson.</p>
