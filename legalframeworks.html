	<h2>The Duty to Accommodate</h2>

<p>Here in Alberta there is a duty to accommodate, both in work places and in schools.</p>

<p>I, as a student with a disability, was never taught this until I encountered the need for it in the post-secondary system. I want to make sure that as a teacher I am providing students with the knowledge of their rights and the systems there to aid them should their rights not be met. I will strive, as both a student teacher and once I am a practicing teacher, to ensure I provide students with this information so that they can be their own advocate, or advocate for those they care about or their future children should they need to.</p>
